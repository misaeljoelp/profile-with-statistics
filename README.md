## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
How to use label figure to show images. 
Practice in css property position to ubicate an image.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
    <figure class="bubbles"></figure>
    <figure class="photo"><img src="./images/image-victor.jpg" alt="Personal Photo"></figure>
```
```css
.card-container{
    position: relative;
}
.photo{
    position: absolute;
    top: 87px;
    left: 35%;
}

```
### Continued development

I would like practice more property position with major dificulties.
